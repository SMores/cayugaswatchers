          Why Watchers?
      </h2>
      <div class="content">
      	<img src="images/kelly-crandall.jpg" alt="Kelly Crandall" width=300 height=413 style="float: left; padding: 20px;">

        <p>
			“Wait, isn’t Cayuga Watchers the all-male acapella group?”
        </p>
        <p>
        	“Uh, no, those are the Cayuga’s <i>Waiters</i>…”
        </p>
        <p>
			Explaining who the Cayuga Watcher’s are isn’t always easy, but I’m always willing to try. I’ve been telling anyone who will listen about Watchers since my freshman year, and the conversation seems to always go the same way. 
        </p>
        <p>
			“We go to parties anonymously, and the team works together to mediate situations through intervention techniques so that everyone stays safe and has fun!”<br>
			“You’re the ones wearing the sober monitor shirts?”<br>
			“No, we try to stay anonymous so we wear typical going out clothes.”<br>
			“And you’re sober the entire time? You never pregame?”<br>
			“No, the whole point is to have more pairs of eyes with sober judgement there!”<br>
			“But <i>why</i> would you want to do this?”
        </p>
        <p>
          	Ahhh, the <i>why</i>. For me, I’ve always been the Mom of the group. Whether I’m trying to keep the group together, holding someone’s hair back and rubbing their back when they get sick, giving that one friend a piggy back ride back to dorm, staying sober to drive people home, or telling off a boy that isn’t quite understanding the word “no.” While I love to have fun, I also love keeping my friends safe.
        </p>
        <p>
			But what happens when no one is there to be Mom? More often than not it’s fine, but sometimes it’s not fine. Bad things can happen all too easily. I found Watchers and learned that I could watch out for my friends, but also all of my peers here at Cornell. Whether it be striking up conversation to distract someone from drinking, dancing with someone who looked a little uncomfortable, grabbing water for someone, or making the tough decisions as to when someone needs help, the Watchers are always looking out for everyone. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Cornell makes us work hard, so we all deserve to relax and have fun. We’re here to make sure that everyone is safe at the end of the night. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, and the $10 an hour isn’t too bad either.

          Spring 2016 Semester in Review: Intervention Data
      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Watchers performed a whopping <strong>361 interventions</strong> throughout SP16, 141 of which were distractions with a non-alcoholic beverage, 181 of which were a distraction with conversation, and 39 of which were stopping an unwanted sexual advance. 
        </p>
        <p class="center">

        </p>
        <p>
          The most common partygoer encountered was the rowdy partygoer, followed by thirsty, sick, and creepy.

        <p>
          On Slope Day 2016, watchers were utilized for two separate shifts that compromised almost the entirety of the day’s events. Watchers performed more than 70 interventions throughout the course of the day which helped to ensure the safety of students during this high-risk end-of-year celebration. Watchers flagged Cornell EMS 12 times during the day, which resulted in 15 EMS transports.         </p>

          Analysis of 2016 Wet Week Events
      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Wet Week is the subsequent week after the initiation deadline during which time new Greeks become socially acclimated and historical increases in medical transports and other alcohol-related incidents persist.         </p>
        <p>
          During Wet Week, CW had 85 employees available for work with 23 working events. Each event had at least 3 watchers, at most 6, and an average of 3.3. The busiest day during the period was Monday, 2/29/2016 with 14 Watchers working at once. This may be a result of the fact that it is the first day after the new member period ends, and therefore the first day that new members can attend “wet” events, mainly mixers with fraternities. In fact, all of the events worked by CW during the week were Greek mixers located at Greek houses. On average, events lasted 2 hours and 43 minutes and were attended by almost 100 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          During training, Watchers learn of different ways that they can mitigate the risks associated with high risk drinking at college parties. Among these are preventing an intoxicated person from drinking more alcohol by providing him or her with water, distracting someone from risky situations with conversation, and acting against unwanted sexual advances. During Wet Week, the most popular method was distracting a partygoer with conversation, which was utilized 55 times. <strong>In total, watchers performed 115 interventions, or an average of more than 7 interventions per event. 12 of these actions were taken against people making unwanted sexual advances. </strong>
        </p>

          <i>Figure 1: Number of times each intervention tactic was used.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          CW groups high-risk partygoers in one of the four following partygoer classifications: rowdy, thirsty, creepy, and sick. During Wet Week, the most frequently observed type was the thirsty partygoer. 
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly believe that these metrics demonstrate how much of a tangible impact Cayuga’s Watchers’ services have on mitigating risky social behavior here at Cornell, and we look forward to continue serving the community for years to come.

        How Can the Cornell Community Fix What We Know is Broken?
      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          This past Monday, the Association of American Universities released the results of a survey that included students from 27 universities. Overall, more than 150,000 students detailed their experiences with sexual assault on college campuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full report (which can be found <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/association-of-american-universities-campus-survey-on-sexual-assault-and-sexual-misconduct/1747/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/association-of-american-universities-campus-survey-on-sexual-assault-and-sexual-misconduct/1747/', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>) includes responses from both Cornell’s undergraduate and graduate population. Our campus had a 19% response rate, which is consistent with the percentage of other student bodies reporting at other universities. More women completed the survey than men, and 1.5 times more undergraduates responded than graduate students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data from the survey revealed the following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            50% of survey respondents had witnessed a drunken person heading for a sexual encounter, but 78% said they did not intervene in the situation
          </li>
          <li>
            22.6% of female undergraduates in the sample size reported experiences of non-consensual sexual contact since they began attending Cornell
          </li>
          <li>
            6% of male undergraduates in the sample size reported experiences of non-consensual sexual contact since they began attending Cornell
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The information presented in the AAU study presents our student body with a harsh reality: this campus is not immune to the nationwide issues surrounding sexual assault. In fact, the data representing Cornell aligns with that of the 26 other universities surveyed from around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          To combat this serious problem plaguing college campuses, we must focus on developing an atmosphere of social responsibility among peers. Because <a href="http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/campus/pages/alcohol.aspx" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/campus/pages/alcohol.aspx', 'alcohol use increases the risk of sexual assault');" target="_blank">alcohol use increases the risk of sexual assault</a>, this social responsibility can be fostered through an emphasis on safe and responsible alcohol consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cayuga’s Watchers believe that through student-led, non-confrontational training, we can encourage a community that supports Cornellians looking after Cornellians. Since our founding three years ago, we have trained over 1300 students in recognizing when to step in before a situation can escalate to something more serious. We understand that problems detailed in the AAU report will not be solved by ignoring or abolishing Cornell’s drinking culture. Because sexual assault is an issue that ultimately affects everyone on our campus, we must focus on peers looking out for one another. With an increased understanding of what to look out for, a safe atmosphere will be created for each member of our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          As President Elizabeth Garrett’s stated in response to the published report, “even one instance of sexual assault on our campus is one too many.” The trainings that Cayuga’s Watchers provides, operating in tandem with administration initiatives such as the Council for Sexual Violence Prevention, propels this campus towards its goal of making sure every Cornellian is protected. Through a cohesive, coordinated effort between students, different organizations, and the administration, we can reach the goal of making our community safe.

      <h2 class="title">Welcome Back!</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Welcome back! The Cayuga’s Watchers team is excited to spend another semester serving the Cornell community and keeping the party safe. I’d like to introduce a few new and exciting additions that we have in store for the upcoming fall semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first? <b>This blog itself</b>. On our blog, you can expect monthly updates about our growing organization and how we are advancing our commitment to mitigate the risks of high-risk drinking. Additionally, these organizational reviews will be accompanied by various posts from employees, parents, student leaders and administrators who wish to join our discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, our “<b>Press Release</b>” section will cover more newsworthy and serious announcements. These will include statements on broader, more contentious issues about alcohol safety or sexual assault that often spark national debate. Other press releases will regard important organizational updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another exciting development is <a href="https://www.givingisgorges.org/organizations/cayuga-s-watchers" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.givingisgorges.org/organizations/cayuga-s-watchers', 'the launch of our second');" target="_blank">the launch of our second</a> GiveGab <b>fundraising campaign</b>, in partnership with GiveGab’s “Giving is Gorges” initiative. Be sure to support our organization when the campaign launches on <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_380679063"><span class="aQJ">August 28th</span></span>. Send the link around to friends, family, or whoever you know that might want to promote student safety here at Cornell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, <b>calling all freshman!</b> Sometime in the next few weeks, Cayuga’s Watchers will be posting up on North Campus, playing some water pong and talking to freshmen who might be interested in becoming Watchers. This year, we’re accepting applications for first semester freshmen, so that they’ll be ready to Watch at events come second semester. If you are a freshman that wants to apply, please <a href="https://cornell.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2hFPXxx1NbQA7UF" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://cornell.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2hFPXxx1NbQA7UF', 'fill out an application');" target="_blank">fill out an application</a> on our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s to another great year of keeping the party safe.
