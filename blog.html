                <h2>Judging Levels of Drunkenness and How Cayuga’s Watchers Can Help</h2>
                <p>A recent study out of <a href="http://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-3469-z">Cardiff University</a> has revealed that when drunk and surrounded by other drinkers, people’s judgements of their own intoxication are actually determined by the drunkenness of their peers, not by the actual amount of alcohol consumed. The study demonstrated that when surrounded by other intoxicated people, individuals underestimate their own level of drinking. However, when individuals are surrounded by people who are more sober, they are more cognizant of the risks associated with their drinking behavior.</p>

                <h2>Why Watchers</h2>
                <p>Ahhh, the <i>why</i>. For me, I’ve always been the Mom of the group. Whether I’m trying to keep the group together, holding someone’s hair back and rubbing their back when they get sick, giving that one friend a piggy back ride back to dorm, staying sober to drive people home, or telling off a boy that isn’t quite understanding the word “no.” While I love to have fun, I also love keeping my friends safe.</p>

                <h2>Spring 2016 Semester in Review: Intervention Data</h2>
                <p>Watchers performed a whopping <b>361 interventions</b> throughout SP16, 141 of which were distractions with a non-alcoholic beverage, 181 of which were a distraction with conversation, and 39 of which were stopping an unwanted sexual advance.</p>
                <p>On Slope Day 2016, watchers were utilized for two separate shifts that compromised almost the entirety of the day’s events. Watchers performed more than 70 interventions throughout the course of the day which helped to ensure the safety of students during this high-risk end-of-year celebration. Watchers flagged Cornell EMS 12 times during the day, which resulted in 15 EMS transports.</p>

                <h2>Analysis of 2016 Wet Week Events</h2>
                <p>During Wet Week, CW had 85 employees available for work with 23 working events. Each event had at least 3 watchers, at most 6, and an average of 3.3. The busiest day during the period was Monday, 2/29/2016 with 14 Watchers working at once. This may be a result of the fact that it is the first day after the new member period ends, and therefore the first day that new members can attend “wet” events, mainly mixers with fraternities. In fact, all of the events worked by CW during the week were Greek mixers located at Greek houses. On average, events lasted 2 hours and 43 minutes and were attended by almost 100 people.</p>

                <h2>How Can the Cornell Community Fix What We Know is Broken?</h2>
                <p>This past Monday, the Association of American Universities released the results of a survey that included students from 27 universities. Overall, more than 150,000 students detailed their experiences with sexual assault on college campuses.</p>
                <p>The full report (which can be found <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/local/association-of-american-universities-campus-survey-on-sexual-assault-and-sexual-misconduct/1747/">here</a>) includes responses from both Cornell’s undergraduate and graduate population. Our campus had a 19% response rate, which is consistent with the percentage of other student bodies reporting at other universities. More women completed the survey than men, and 1.5 times more undergraduates responded than graduate students.</p>

                <p>Welcome back! The Cayuga’s Watchers team is excited to spend another semester serving the Cornell community and keeping the party safe. I’d like to introduce a few new and exciting additions that we have in store for the upcoming fall semester.</p>
                <p>The first? <b>This blog itself</b>. On our blog, you can expect monthly updates about our growing organization and how we are advancing our commitment to mitigate the risks of high-risk drinking. Additionally, these organizational reviews will be accompanied by various posts from employees, parents, student leaders and administrators who wish to join our discussion.</p>
